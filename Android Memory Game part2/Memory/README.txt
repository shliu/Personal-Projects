For some reason this program crashes whenever I try to run it 
in my emulator.  However, it runs perfectly on my android phone.
Please contact me for demonstrations if it doesn't run for you.

In order for this program to work, please upload the attached 
plants images to the "/external_sd/DCIM/Camera" folder (this 
requires an external SD card).

After upload the pictures, simply run the program and it should 
begin working.  The program is capable of detecting new images in 
the above mentioned directory, so simply take a picture with the
android camera (with the option set to save to external SD card)
and then return to the game.  The game will automatically update
the list of available images to include any new pictures.

Unfortunately at this time the camera must be started from 
outside the memory game program.  I did not have time to implement
an ingame button to start a new camera intent.
